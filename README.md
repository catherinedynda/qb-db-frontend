# IO Quote Board Frontend

This is the front end for searching the IO Quote Board database. Very much in progress.

This project made using create-react-app and Material UI mostly.

# To Run

Make sure the backend is running. Also have the right URLs for it in the frontend (currently they're just localhost addresses that are manually typed in). Run `npm start` in the root folder. It should go.

# Roadmap

-   [ ] Hook up to running actual searches
-   [ ] Make display for fetched quotes
-   [ ] Complete desired parts of form
-   [ ] Think more about design
    -   [ ] Fix stuff running into each other, make it more of a responsive grid?
-   [ ] Make stats area? Separate page of app?
